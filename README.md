# Source-Final
This is a src for a WOW Legion Build that was apparently used as a base line for many of the big name emu-servers that that is out there. I am unsure of the completeness and was given widely different backstories to how this became available. I am unsure of the % of what is and isnt working. However it offers more then the trinitycore git and has numerous custom scripts. I am working mainly on a seperate build of my own with help from someone else with a completely different src. This src is provided as a public service for anyone wanting to dive into the wow emu dev scene. I am posting this src in hopes of other community builds being made possible in the future for the enjoyment of others.

SRC 11/2018
